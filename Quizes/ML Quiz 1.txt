Some Questions related to Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Q1. In linear regression, which assumption is made about the relationship between independent and dependent variables?
→ Linear and homoscedastic

Q2. What does a high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) indicate in multiple linear regression?
→ High multicollinearity

Q3. Which of the following methods penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients?
→ Lasso Regression

Q4. Which of the following is not an assumption of the linear regression model?
→ All independent variables are categorical

Q5. What is the effect of standardizing input variables in regularized linear regression?
→ Ensures fair penalization of weights

Q6. Which method minimizes the sum of squared residuals?
→ Ordinary Least Squares

Q7. Which condition would lead to an overfitted linear regression model?
→ High model complexity on small data

Q8. What does a low p-value (e.g., < 0.05) for a coefficient in linear regression suggest?
→ Strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis

Q9. Which algorithm is commonly used to compute the coefficients in gradient descent for linear regression?
→ Partial derivatives of cost function

Q10. Ridge regression adds what type of penalty to the cost function?
→ L2 penalty

Q11. Which evaluation metric is most sensitive to outliers in linear regression?
→ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Q12. In multiple linear regression, what does adjusted R-squared do that R-squared doesn’t?
→ Adjusts for the number of predictors

Q13. Which regression method is best when most predictors are irrelevant?
→ Lasso Regression

Q14. What does it mean when the residuals are not randomly scattered around zero?
→ Model has heteroscedasticity or is misspecified

Q15. What happens to the bias and variance when we use Ridge regression instead of Linear regression?
→ Bias ↑, Variance ↓

Q16. Which condition indicates that a linear regression model is underfitting?
→ High bias and low variance

Q17. Which of these is a limitation of using R-squared for model selection?
→ It always increases with more variables

Q18. What type of variable can linear regression NOT handle without preprocessing?
→ Categorical variables

Q19. Which situation makes linear regression inappropriate?
→ Independent variables are correlated

Q20. Elastic Net is a combination of which two regularization techniques?
→ Lasso and Ridge
